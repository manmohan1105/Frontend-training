# Bdaysort
## Bday's Sort - Create an application that sorts a list of people by name and age. Description - Application initial state should display a table with unsorted list of people records. Read these records(having only name and birth date as properties) from a json file with help of http(do not directly import the file). The sort by name radio button sorts list by ascending name. The sort by age radio button sorts list by descending age(i.e ascending date). Use 2 child components - table one for displaying data in table and second one for radio button implementation and render both of them in parent app component.
